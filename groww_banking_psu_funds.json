The vision of the company is to provide opportunities to investors so that they can achieve sustainable prosperity by investing responsibly in the capital markets.The AMC was set up on December 30, 2009, with the aim to formulate a robust asset management portfolio in India. They already had access to the extensive client base of Union Bank of India, which they capitalised on extensively.The AMC was set up in collaboration with KBC Asset Management NV, a Belgium-based AMC. It was initially known asUnion KBC Mutual Fund. Union Bank always held the majority stake in the company while KBC controlled a 49% share.The partnership ended in 2016 when KBC pulled out of the agreement and Union Bank of India purchased their shares, making Union Mutual Fund their wholly owned subsidy.Subsequently, in 2017, Dai-ichi Life, a major financial services company from Japan, acquired 39.62% stake at the AMC. Although no changes have been made to the existing structure of the AMC, Dai-ichi would appoint one nominee to its Board of Directors.About SponsorsCurrently, Union Mutual Fund is jointly sponsored by the Union Bank of India and Dai-ichi Life.Union Bank of IndiaUnion Bank of India (UBI) is one of the most significant government-owned banks in the country, which will complete a hundred years of existence in 2019. It was inaugurated by none other than Mahatma Gandhi on November 11, 1919. Even before Indian independence, UBI was a significant financial institution in the country entirely run by Indians.

Its asset management wing, the Mirae Asset Global Investments, commenced operation in 1997 and has expanded its business globally in a relatively short span of time. Today,Mirae Asset Mutual Fundhas its presence in 14 countries spread across 5 continents. From the USA to Europe and India, Mirae Asset has been helping people invest prudently through their asset management company.Originating in the backdrop of the Asian currency crisis, Mirae Asset began cautiously, concentrating more on the Korean market initially. Founded by the visionary Hyeon Joo Park, Mirae Asset became the first AMC to present mutual funds to retail investors back in 1998.After consolidating its presence in the South Korean market, Mirae Asset swiftly moved to capture the global market. The first straw was the establishment of their corporate office in Hong Kong in 2003. Today, Mirae Asset has a strong presence in India, Australia, Canada, Brazil, Indonesia, the USA, the UK and Vietnam, among others.In its relatively short but decorated history,Mirae Asset Mutual Fundshas reached several landmarks, previously unheard of from Korean AMCs. In 2005, they launched the first overseas investment in South Korea, the Mirae Asset Retirement Pension Fund. Just two years later, they launched their business in India and the UK.The following year, they expanded to the USA and Brazil while winning accolades for being the largest investor in the emerging Asian markets. They even penetrated the traditionally closed Chinese market as they became the first and only Korean company to set up a joint venture AMC in the country, namely Mirae Asset Huachen Fund Management.The Indian wing of the AMC, Mirae Asset Global Investments (India) Pvt. Ltd. was launched in the November of 2007, becoming only their second overseas branch after Hong Kong.

It is a subsidiary of the much older JM Financial Group, which has a rich pedigree and long standing in the financial services sector of India.The mother company’s origins can be traced back to the first decade of Indian independence, when the group’s founder, the Kampani family, started taking an interest in the then embryonic capital funds market.The first financial company under the group, JM Financial & Investment Consultancy Services, opened its gates on 15 September 1973. It’s first Chairperson, Mr. Nimesh N. Kriplani, was already an established name in the financial services sector, having played a pivotal part in educating the Indian populace about the ins and outs of investing in blue-chip companies.Over a decade later, on January 30, 1986, JM Share & Stock Brokers (JMSSB) was established. It was the precursor to JM Financial Asset Management Ltd, the AMC ofJM Financial Mutual Funds.JM Financial Ltd started its journey on a high, simultaneously launching three funds, namely, JM Equity Fund, JM Liquid Fund (later renamed JM Income Fund), and JM Balanced Fund. These would go on to become the building blocks for a diverse portfolio of funds that JM Financial would launch swiftly in the next decades.Having entered a Joint Venture with the world’s leading financial services company, Morgan Stanley, in 1997, JM Financial Ltd expanded its wings exponentially. By 2001, the company had repaid all its loans in full and redeemed its last instalment of a 14% Debenture, making it a zero debt organisation for the first time since it started operations.In 2006, the company reached two important milestones- it launched a corporate, private equity fund and merged J.M. Securities Pvt. Ltd. The acquisition spree continued well into 2008 when they amalgamated JM Financial ASK Securities Pvt. Ltd. In the same year, JM Financial entered a strategic agreement with an aim to offer advisory services to African and Indian corporate firms on their operations on the Indo-African corridor.JM Financial has been involved in several other strategic partnerships with prominent finance management companies such as Seabury and Fairassets Technologies India Pvt.

Tenures have a heavy bearing on the returns from a Mutual Fund.Step 6: If you are looking forward to invest only once but with a considerable sum, choose the “Invest One Time” option. Else, if you plan to start a Systematic Investment Plan, choose the “Start SIP” option.It generally takes 2-3 business days for the results to reflect in the Groww account you hold. It is advisable to visit your account as many times as possible.Top Fund ManagersMr. Sanjeev SharmaMr. Sharma is one of the most seminal figures in the annals of the Indian banking and Mutual Funds industry.

Thanks to unified platforms like Groww, you can start investing very soon.Here are the steps which you must follow:Step 1. The first step is to sign in to Groww using your password and Log-in ID. In case you are a first-time visitor, you may choose to register your account for free with Groww. Registration is easy and requires minimal documentation.Step 2. Upload any proof of your identity. Accepted documents in this section include PAN, Aadhaar, Voter ID Card, a valid driving license from any of the 29 states of Union Territories, valid ID proof provided by either the State of Central Governments, a Passport etc.Step 3. You must now verify your address. Any document which mentions both your name and your permanent residence will suffice.Step 4. You have to choose your risk appetite. Go to the Mahindra Manulife Mutual Funds section on the Groww website and click on risk level you choose. You can select any one of high, moderate and low risks.Step 5. After the risk factor is settled, select the Mahindra Manulife Mutual Funds in which you plan to invest straight from our website.Step 6. If you are planning to invest a lump sum amount at once, choose the option that says “Invest One Time”. On the other hand, most people plan to set up a new SIP. Click on “Start SIP” to start investing at once.Remember that risks and amounts invested both come into play to yield dividends. The higher the risk, the greater the returns. However, if there is market turbulence and Mutual Funds buckle under the pressure, those with highest risk levels may face exposure. Low risks likewise translate to lower yields. If you have confidence in your judgment or have access to quality service, you can opt for medium-risk Mutual Funds.Note that your investment will reflect in your Groww account within 3-4 working days only.Top Fund ManagersMs Fatema Pacha (Fund Manager – Equity)Ms Fatema Pacha holds a PGDBM (Finance) from SP Jain Institute of Management & Research, Mumbai and a BE (Computers) from Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Mumbai.With more than 17 years of experience in equity research and fund management, she has been associated with many renowned companies, such as ICICI Prudential Life Insurance and UTI Mutual Fund.Mr Manish Lodha (Fund Manager – Equity)Mr Manish Lodha carries an experience of more than 22 years during which he has worked in the Mutual Fund Industry, Life Insurance Industry, etc.He worked with Kotak Mahindra Mutual Fund and Canara HSBC OBC Life Insurance Co Ltd before joining Mahindra Manulife Mutual Funds.He is a Chartered Accountant and a Company Secretary.Mr Amit Garg (Fund Manager – Fixed Income)With an experience of over 17 years, Mr Amit Garg has been working in the Fixed Income field successfully.

Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd. is the parent company which is in control of the entire group of companies.Edelweiss Financial Services commenced its operations in 1996 and has been a key driver of the Indian financial sector ever since. It got the license to deal in mutual funds in 2008, amongst the global economic slowdown. Despite the odds stacked against them, they set up Edelweiss Asset Management Ltd. (EAML) and launched mutual funds in a market that was showing no signs of picking up.However, with their brilliant investment strategy and a broad portfolio of funds,Edelweiss Mutual Fundssoon picked up the pace and has been growing at a brisk pace ever since. Apart from mutual funds, EAML also deals in Alternative Investments.Currently, EAMC offers a portfolio of 84 funds to its investors. Their total Assets Under Management (AuM) stands at Rs. 125125.38 Crore, making them one of the largest AMCs in India. The AMC has branches at 11 locations across the country.The primary aim of the AMC is to present its investors with the broadest range of investment products and the necessary customer support to maximise wealth creation. Broadly speaking, there are three types of funds that you can invest in through EAML- Equity, Debt and Liquid.Unlike traditional AMCs, EAML relies on innovation and an unconventional approach to investing. As a result, EAML is considered one of the most tech-friendly investment houses in the country, arguably the only one that focuses extensively on the digital experience of their clients.About SponsorEdelweiss Asset Management Limited is sponsored and managed by Edelweiss Financial Services Limited, an Indian conglomerate operating in the financial services sector of the country since 1996.The company started as a tailored investment bank, specialising in mergers & acquisitions, private equity syndication and similar advisory services. It soon spread its wings to other areas of finance, offering its clients a broad range of financial products and services cutting across asset classes and consumer segments, both locally and on a global scale.The next stage of development came when they acquired the license of being a merchant bank at the turn of the millennium. At this point, they focused on helping start-ups raise capital through the non-IPO mediums such as Private Equity Funds and Venture Capital.The growth of the company continued unabated in the following decade. They added the Non-banking Financial Company and Institutional Broking to their portfolio of services. They followed it up by setting the Edelweiss Global Wealth Management in 2007, the Indian extension of which is Edelweiss Asset Management Limited.Edelweiss strongly associates itself with corporate social responsibilities.

They have over 20 years of experience in fund management at the highest level. At the time of its inception in 1996, the AMC was co-sponsored by Sundaram Finance Limited and Stewart Newton Holdings (Mauritius).The company has a chequered history, with multiple acquisitions and counter-acquisitions throughout its existence. Its parent organisation, Sundaram Finance Ltd., was incorporated back in 1954, becoming one of the first financial organisations to be formed in independent India. With a relatively meagre paid-up capital of Rs. 2 Lakh, their primary objective at the time was to fund the purchase of passenger as well as commercial vehicles. The company became public in 1972 and has since then dealt in various areas of finance including but not limited to mutual funds, general insurance, home and car finance, and financial services distribution.As of now, Sundaram Finance Ltd. is one of the largest financial institutions in India with reported net assets worth over Rs. 28,000 Crore and annual gross revenue of over Rs. 5000 Crore.Sundaram AMC was formed in 1996 in a bid to separate Sundaram’s mutual fund division from its core financing operations. Sundaram has had a long association with the Newton group, which co-funded the AMC at the time. In 2002, however, Newton Investment Management was acquired by Mellon Financial Corporation. Sundaram took the opportunity to acquire Newton group’s holding in the merged company.Another company that Sundaram AMC has a history with is the French financial giant, BNP Paribas Asset Management (BNP PAM), which acquired a 49.9% equity stake at Sundaram AMC in the year 2006. The joint venture, however, was short-lived.In 2010, BNP PAM had to relieve its stake atSundaram Mutual Fundas it acquired the Fortis group, and government regulations dictate that a company can only promote one mutual fund.

Currently, Principal Mauritius Private Limited has a share of 65% overall, while Punjab National Bank owns 30% of the company and Vijaya Bank owns 5%.All three partners currently hold all rights, liabilities, titles and interest of the Mutual Funds house.As of March 2019,Principal Mutual Fundhas 67 active schemes.

Being a part of the 7th largest bank in the world, it offers international quality investment options and services to prospective investors across the nation.HSBC Mutual Fundserves more than 1 million customers through its 1000 plus offices spread all over India. It operates with a total corpus of Rs. 109825.42 Crore as of 2024, and offers more than 103 different types of schemes under three types of options, equity, debt, and product add-on funds.An abbreviation of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the HSBC empire is over 100 years old and was established by Sir Thomas Sutherland in 1886. It is the world’s 7th largest bank in terms of total assets and revenues. Although it is owned by the British, it has an unbeatable track record in wealth and asset management in South Asia too, besides retail and corporate banking.Given the unpredictable atmosphere in Hong Kong over the ‘One Nation Two System’ norm, HSBC was though to face stiff resistance in entering the Mutual Funds business in India. That, however, did not happen because of their excellent track record in almost every department of banking.The HSBC empire has more than 100 million active customers all over the world in every continent except the Polar regions. It has a total market capitalisation of more than £102.7 billion as of the end of 2018.

The AMC is registered as a trust under the Indian Trust Act, 1882. It is registered with SEBI vide registration code MF/069/12.As of March 2024, the AMC offers more than six schemes and has an asset under management of Rs. 64295.79 Crore.PPFAS AMC abides by the “Law of the Farm”. The law relates to farming, where a farmer can only reap fruitful produce slowly and steadily while practising with effort and discipline. The company has relatively prolonged holding periods, a reflection of this law.The AMC prides itself of having a different and unique approach to asset management than other companies.For instance, the company only offers 1 equity scheme. It believes that they can invest in a plethora of areas through this single product. They refrain from launching more schemes as it might create confusion among clients and become perplexing when choosing a fund to invest in.Secondly, it does not have a sales team. The company does not subscribe to attracting investors by heavily promoting its products. It has a small team of Relationship Managers who seek to establish a robust and long-term relation with the clients. They do not conclude their services once an investor completes the purchase. The official will clear any queries and doubts that their clients have, anytime.The company boasts of its investment management team and maintains that their approach to performance and asset management is the ideal way to market and sell their products.Thirdly, it does not utilise the modern factors like algorithms, technical analysis, and momentum to curate a portfolio. Instead, the company uses age-old factors like low debt, cash flow, etc. PPFAS does not seek to attract investors that look for fund managers who have an aggressive approach to the market.Fourthly, the mutual fund does not accept one-time investments during bullish times. It says that investing during such time may return high profits but it can also backfire.Fifthly, PPFAS AMC believes that the interest of clients should be similar to those of their employees and management. Hence, their workforce also invests a considerable amount of their investable surplus in the company’s equity fund.The only twoPPFAS Mutual Fundsavailable are:I.

It has been in constant transactions since 1993 when the Indian Government mostly owned the biggest players in the business. Taurus Mutual Fund was also one of the first private players in Mutual Funds to register themselves with the SEBI.Over its 25 years of operations, Taurus has managed to expand its portfolio to several Long Term and Short-Medium Term Mutual Funds. Registered in 1993, Taurus has had a successful journey in the market with multiple plans, including its first plan- Taurus Starshare- which is still going strong today.Taurus MF is registered with Code No. MF/002/93 with SEBI and is currently one of India’s 10 largest Mutual Funds in terms of Assets Under Management.Taurus has also had a very eventful history in India. It was the first private player to receive permission to manage investment profiles from NRIs and FIIs. Over the last decade, Taurus Mutual Fund has received a series of investments from the likes of IFC in Washington DC to the European Commission Investment Corporation headquartered in Brussels, the capital of Belgium.Today, the Mutual Fund is managed by HB Portfolio Limited, which is also the Asset Management Company or AMC. It also has a Board of Trustees in the form of the Taurus Investment Trust Company, which is the de facto management of the Private Mutual Fund Company.Taurus Mutual Fundis one of India’s most technologically sophisticated Mutual Fund houses. It was one of the first players to join the growing bandwagon to shift their operations online. Thanks to a hugely respected team of dedicated fund managers on its board of managers, Taurus has managed to retain a large population of India’s 29 states and 7 Union Territories as its loyal clientele.Given that it has over 5000 branches across India, with a presence in more than 30 major cities and 50-odd smaller towns, Taurus has managed to penetrate what is considered a profoundly conservative market.While the Mutual Funds business has continued to prosper, the management has changed multiple times. Two promoters- HB Mutual Fund & Taurus Mutual Fund- had merged in 1999 and formed a new entity listed as Creditcapital Asset Management Co. Ltd. Later in 2006, Creditcapital was renamed to Taurus Asset Management Co. Ltd.In 2002, Taurus took over some portions of the BOI Mutual Fund. Post that, the market share ofTaurus Mutual Fundshas risen even more.To comply with all domestic market norms and international standards, the Mutual Funds major has also teamed up with one of the world’s largest commercial banking entities- Deutsche Bank. HDFC Bank Ltd has control over most of its assets and also serves as a guarantor.With over Rs. 739.26 Crore worth AuM as of 2024, Taurus Mutual Fund is one of the fastest expanding Mutual Fund majors.List of Taurus Mutual Fund in IndiaFund NameCategoryRiskNAVExpense Ratio1Y Returns3Y Returns5Y ReturnsRatingFund Size (in Cr)Exit LoadTaurus ELSS Tax Saver FundEquityVery High206.421.796.9%17.6%17.8%4₹78-Taurus Flexi Cap FundEquityVery High239.182.564.0%14.7%15.8%2₹363Exit load of 1% if redeemed within 365 days.Taurus Large Cap FundEquityVery High172.732.418.3%14.7%15.8%2₹51Exit load of 1% if redeemed within 365 days.Taurus Banking & Financial Services FundEquityVery High62.061.5713.5%13.6%15.4%2₹12Exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 365 days.Taurus Nifty 50 Index FundEquityVery High52.870.812.2%12.9%15.8%2₹6Exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 365 days.Taurus Infrastructure FundEquityVery High73.581.915.4%19.8%22.3%1₹9Exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 365 days.Taurus Mid Cap FundEquityVery High130.082.076.5%18.4%19.7%1₹133Exit load of 1% if redeemed within 365 days.Taurus Ethical FundEquityVery High145.990.913.5%15.8%17.1%--₹353Exit load of 1% if redeemed within 365 days.View AllKey informationMutual fund nameTaurus Mutual FundAMC Setup Date20 August 1993AMC Incorporation Date27 July 1993Sponsor nameHB Portfolio LimitedTrustee organisationTaurus Investment Trust Company LimitedChairmanRajkiran Rai G.CIOMr. Dheeraj SinghMD and CEOMr. Waqar Naqvi and R.

It has managed to retain a significant share of its clients in major cities because it has delivered consistent and increasing returns since its inception in 1993. You too can invest inTaurus Mutual Funds onlinevia the secured website Groww.Here are the steps you need to remember.Step 1: Sign in to your personal account on Groww. In case you do not have a personal ID on Groww, you can easily set up one today. It requires minimal documentation and very little time as well.Step 2: You now need to upload your documents of identification, a process very similar to the KYC documentation which you complete at financial establishments. Accepted documents include a Passport, Voter ID card, PAN, Aadhaar card, a valid driving licence, an identification document issued by either the Central or a State Government, whichever is applicable for you.Step 3: You must now provide residential address proof. Accepted documents in this section include any official document which mentions your permanent residence.Step 4: Once the documentation process is completed, you need to select the tenure of Mutual Funds. You can choose a Long-Term, Short-Term, or Medium-Term tenure. Longer plans may have greater returns, but it takes many years to run its course. Shorter schemes may have higher risks associated.Step 5: You now need to choose from high, low and medium risks. It depends on the amount you are investing and your risk appetite too. Keep in mind that Groww encourages you to contact your specialist advisors before you invest.Step 6: Choose the “Invest One Time” option if you are planning to invest a substantial sum of money for an extended period at one go. You can also start a systematic investment plan or SIP by clicking on “Start a SIP”.Taurus Mutual Fundsoffer both options.Also, note that the changes will start reflecting in your Groww account after 3 to 4 business days only. You must keep track of it accordingly.Top Fund Managers1. Mr. Waqar NaqviMr. Waqar Naqvi is the Chief Executive Officer atTaurus Mutual Fund.

It also reached another milestone in 1986 with what was India’s first Offshore fund, called simply the ‘India Fund.’One of the feats achieved by the UTI Asset Management company was to create the UTI Wealth Builder Fund which links two separate but closely related asset classes- Gold and Equity. Thanks to the huge number of subscribers, the UTI Mutual Fund is still going strong in the Indian market.The fund managers at UTI Asset Management, which manages the Mutual Funds, have divested widely and are involved in a wide array of businesses, including retirement solutions, portfolio management solutions, International Banking and alternative assets management.List of UTI Mutual Fund in IndiaFund NameCategoryRiskNAVExpense Ratio1Y Returns3Y Returns5Y ReturnsRatingFund Size (in Cr)Exit LoadUTI Gold ETF FoF FundCommoditiesHigh23.690.1858.6%31.9%NA5₹608Exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 15 daysUTI Healthcare FundEquityVery High325.551.314.2%25.4%18.5%4₹1,124Exit load of 1% if redeemed within 30 days.UTI Large & Mid Cap FundEquityVery High198.780.979.7%23.0%24.6%4₹5,291Exit load of 1% if redeemed less than 1 yearUTI Aggressive Hybrid FundHybridVery High447.441.238.4%17.3%19.1%4₹6,595Exit load of 1% if units in excess of 10% are redeemed or switched-out within 12 monthsSee moreUTI Equity Savings FundHybridModerately High20.090.649.3%11.8%12.2%4₹746Exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 30 days.UTI Multi Asset Allocation FundHybridVery High87.350.5813.1%21.3%16.7%3₹6,375Exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 30 days.UTI Small Cap FundEquityVery High27.770.643.1%19.7%NA3₹4,917Exit load of 1% if redeemed within one year.UTI Value FundEquityVery High189.581.187.9%19.3%20.3%3₹10,057Exit Load for units in excess of 10% of the investment,1% will be charged for redemption within 1 year.See moreUTI Banking and Financial Services FundEquityVery High225.901.1118.9%17.1%18.1%3₹1,346Exit load of 1%, if redeemed within 30 days.UTI Focused FundEquityVery High16.840.628.7%16.9%NA3₹2,637Exit load of 1% if redeemed within 365 days.UTI BSE Low Volatility Index FundEquityVery High17.350.4410.2%16.1%NA3₹568-UTI Nifty 50 Index FundEquityVery High182.140.1712.8%13.8%16.3%3₹25,747-UTI Large Cap FundEquityVery High310.320.9310.5%13.6%15.9%3₹13,241Exit Load for units in excess of 10% of the investment,1% will be charged for redemption within 1 year.See moreUTI Conservative Hybrid FundHybridModerately High76.401.247.4%10.4%10.3%3₹1,709Exit Load for units in excess of 10% of the investment,1% will be charged for redemption within 12 months.See moreUTI Credit Risk FundDebtModerately High19.850.888.3%8.1%10.1%3₹257For units in excess of 10% of the investment,1% will be charged for redemption within 365 daysSee moreView AllKey informationMutual fund nameUTI Mutual FundAMC Setup DateFebruary 1, 2003AMC Incorporation Date05 September 1994Sponsor nameState Bank of India / Punjab National Bank / Bank of Baroda / Life Insurance CorporationTrustee organisationUTI Trustee Co (P) LtdCompliance OfficerMr. Vivek MaheshwariInvestor Service OfficerMs Nanda MalaiMD and CEOMr. Imtaiyazur RahmanTotal AUM (as of end of last quarter)₹21.05 lakhWhy invest withGroww?— Registered withSEBI, AMFI&BSE— Paperless sign up on web & app— Expert recommendations— ZERO fees !Sign UpHow can you invest in UTI Mutual Funds?Investing in anyUTI Mutual Fundis easy when you have your own Groww account.

The specific asset allocation depends on the type of high-risk mutual fund.Risk-reward ratio:High-risk mutual funds involve significant volatility, as the classification suggests. However, thebest high riskmutual funds2024also offer sizeable returns.TaxabilityThe treatment is carried out as per the concerned fund’s asset allocation.Long-term Capital Gains Tax:A 10% tax rate is applicable on gains exceeding Rs.1 lakh if the fund units are sold after one year. It only applies to schemes investing a more significant share in equity and equity-related instruments. In case a high-risk fund invests predominantly in debt securities, it’ll be treated as a debt fund for taxation. Thereby, gains realised after 3 years will be liable for a 20% tax + indexation benefits.Short-term Capital Gains Tax:Capital gains on equity-oriented high-risk funds held for less than a year attract taxation @15% + cess, notwithstanding the amount. Conversely, gains realised from debt-based funds within 36 months of investment are taxed per an investor’s income slab. For example, suppose an investor belongs to the 15% tax bracket. Herein, any gains from a debt high risk fund are added to their income and taxed @15%.TDS:Dividend pay-outs of over Rs.5000 from equity-based high-risk mutual funds attract a 10%TDS. Tax deducted at source does not apply to debt-based funds.Who Are These Funds Suited For?High-risk funds are most suitable for investors with in-depth knowledge about the market and a fair understanding of macroeconomic trends.

It helps one determine the quantum of investment they need to make and the time period for which they want to hold their stakes.Risk appetite:Even though these funds offer high liquidity, they remain unaffected by interest rate risk and credit risk, unlike liquid mutual funds. Nevertheless, inflation risk can reduce projected returns, which is why investors must be wary of the same. To scale investments, it’s necessary to determine the level of losses or reduction in gains one can digest shall a scheme underperform.Past performance:Checking how such a low-risk fund has performed in the past three years against a benchmark index is crucial for guaranteed returns.

Credit risk is eliminated for these options. Additionally, interest rate fluctuations do not hamper returns from these instruments. In most cases, low-risk funds also manage to offset the effects of inflation. However, a minimal risk from this factor remains.Source of regular income:Besides securing the capital, thebest low-risk mutual fundscan act as a supplementary source of income as well.Tax savings for certain income slabs:Individuals falling under the higher slab rates can save a significant amount in taxes by investing in these funds instead of FD. Such tax savings is more apparent in terms of long-term capital gains, which offer indexation benefits.Higher returns when compared to fixed deposits:Bank fixed deposits are a preferred form of investment for individuals with minimal risk appetite.

Low risk mutual funds can offer the same level of security for the underlying capital while also offering increased returns.Enhanced liquidity:Investors opting for low liquidity funds often face a severe cash crunch during financial emergencies. These low-risk funds ensure that liquidity is never a problem. Investors can quickly access their share to curtail emergencies.Considering all of these aspects is crucial before investing in such a fund. Doing so will maximise ROI and help achieve investment goals.How long does it take to start investing in very low risk mutual funds if I do not have a KYC?It is not possible for any investor to start investing in mutual funds without having completed the KYC process.\n\nUnder the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), Know Your Customer (KYC) norms have been mandated to track the legality of funds used in an investment. KYC is a one-time process which every first-time mutual fund investor needs to follow, to be able to invest in a mutual fund. \n\nKYC process on Groww can be completed in 2-3 days.\n\nKYC can be completed online with the help of E-KYC or electronic KYC.\n\nE-KYC Aadhar (based on OTP) : Investor can use online KYC facility using just the aadhar card number and PAN number, by visiting the website and following the easy process. After entering relevant details like aadhar and PAN number, investor will receive an OTP and KYC will be completed instantly.
